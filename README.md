# Frontend for Backend (FFB)

A TypeScript library that simplifies integration with Backend as a Service (BAAS) providers like Supabase or Appwrite, abstracting implementation details away from the frontend.

## Features

- Wrapping popular BAAS providers such as Supabase and Appwrite.
- Simplified interface: the frontend only needs to provide the BAAS URL and API key.
- Reduces frontend complexity by delegating communication logic to the library.
- Easily extendable to support additional BAAS services.
